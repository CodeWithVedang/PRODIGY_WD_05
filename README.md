# 🌦️ Weather App

## 📌 Project Overview

This is **Task 5** of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **Weather Web Application** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to view real-time weather information for any city or their current location, complete with a responsive design and smooth UI animations.

## ✨ Features

✅ Real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API  
✅ Search by city or use device’s location via Geolocation API  
✅ Animated skeleton loading for smooth UX  
✅ Weather-based dynamic background changes  
✅ Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI  
✅ Weather icons and detailed metrics (humidity, wind speed)  
✅ Keyboard accessibility with "Enter" key search  
✅ Error handling and fallback icon support

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Search Functionality:**  
   Users can enter a city name to fetch and display its weather.

2. **Geolocation Access:**  
   Clicking “Use My Location” retrieves weather based on current coordinates.

3. **Skeleton Loader:**  
   While data loads, a shimmer animation simulates a loading screen for better UX.

4. **Weather Display:**  
   Displays city name, temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and an icon.

5. **Dynamic Backgrounds:**  
   Background gradient updates based on weather (e.g., clear, rain, clouds).

6. **Error Handling:**  
   Provides feedback if the city is not found or if location access is denied.

## 🎬 Animations & UX Enhancements

- **Skeleton Loading Animation** while fetching data  
- **Dynamic backgrounds** to reflect weather visually  
- **CSS transitions and keyframe animations** for fade-in, bounce, and shake effects  
- **Responsive design** adapts for mobile and desktop screens
